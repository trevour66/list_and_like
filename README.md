# Instagram Engagement & Community Manager

## Overview

The Instagram Engagement & Community Manager is a web application designed to streamline how users manage and interact with their Instagram community. It provides tools to create custom lists, track interactions with posts and Reels, and identify top engagers and leads. While direct interaction with Instagram posts isn't possible, users can easily navigate to Instagram to perform these actions.

## Features

1. **Custom List Management**:  
   Users can create and manage lists (e.g., current clients, past clients, leads, affiliates, podcast guests) using a Google Chrome plugin that overlays Instagram. The plugin pulls profile pictures, IG handles, bios, and account links into the app. The app tracks posts or Reels published within 14 days for engagement.

2. **Community Area**:  
   Displays recent posts from accounts that have engaged with your content. Includes two sliders to control the number of max posts per user and the time frame of content published. Users can choose to like, comment, or skip these posts through the app, which redirects them to Instagram for interaction.

3. **Top Engagers & Leads**:  
   A dashboard displaying top engagers and leads with their profile pictures, IG handles, names, bio texts, and website links. Users can filter leads based on their engagement history over the past 1 to 30 days.

4. **Post & Reel Management**:  
   The app shows your posts and Reels with comments that need to be replied to, giving options to like, skip, like + skip, or comment + like. You can also remove someone from your Lead list.

5. **User Management**:  
   Admins can grant and revoke access to the app for multiple users, allowing them to manage their Instagram interactions within the platform.

6. **Future Enhancements**:  
   Upcoming features include Zapier integrations for automated workflows, further enhancing the app's capabilities.
